# Lab2 - DP based global routing 

**Deadline: 5/20/2026 23:59** 

## Problem Description 
Implement a global router that can complete ISPD 2008 Global Routing Contest [^1], and try to minimize the total overflow (TOF), max overflow (MOF), wirelength (WL) and runtime. 

## Input Format (Parser is provided)
* All benchmarks have multiple metal layers (three-dimensional), with additional congestion information. 
* The input file format specifies the size and shape of the global routing graph, the capacity on edges of the graph, the number of signal nets, and the number of pins and their positions within each net. 
* Example below illustrates a problem with five routing layers. Text in brackets are just comments, they will not be in actual input files.
    ``` 
    grid # # # 
    vertical capacity # # # # # (vertical capacity by default on each layer)
    horizontal capacity # # # # # 
    minimum width # # # # # 
    minimum spacing # # # # # 
    via spacing # # # # # 
    lower_left_x lower_left_y tile_width tile_height 
    num net # 
    netname id_# number_of_pins minimum_width 
    x y layer 
    x y layer 
    [repeat for the appropriate number of nets] 
    # capacity adjustments (to model congestion) 
    column row layer column row layer reduced_capacity_level 
    [repeat for the number of capacity adjustments] 
    ```
### Descriptions: 
* In the vertical and horizontal capacity lines, the first number indicates the capacity on the first layer, the second number indicates the second layer, and so on. 
* Minimum wire widths/spacings are also specified; this impacts capacity calculations. 
* The lower left corner (minimum X and Y) of the global routing region is specified, as well as the width (X dimension) and height (Y dimension) of each tile. 
* Pin positions are given as XY locations, rather than tile locations. 
* Conversion from pin positions to tile numbers can be done with:
$floor(pin\_x - lower\_left\_x) / tile\_width$
$floor(pin\_y - lower\_left\_y) / tile\_height$.
 Pins will **NOT** be on the borders of global routing cells, so there should be no ambiguity. 
* All pins will be within the specified global routing region. 
* Each net will have a minimum routed width; this width will span **all layers**. 
* When routing, compute the utilization of a global routing graph edge by adding the widths of all nets crossing and edge, plus the minimum spacing multiplied by the number of nets. 
* Each wire will require spacing between its neighbors; think of this as having one-half of the minimum spacing reserved on each side of a wire. 
* Example of computing the utilization:
![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1eEKfXsZl.png)

  If the value of minimum spacing in this layer is 10, then the demand of red grid edge is $40+20+60+10+10+10=150$. 
* Congestion is modeled by including capacity adjustments. Pairs of (adjacent) global routing tiles may have a capacity that is different from the default values specified at the start of a benchmark file. 
* Capacity specified in the $2^{nd}$ and $3^{rd}$ lines is a measure of the available space, not the number of global routing tracks. 
* If the minimum wire width is 20, the minimum spacing 10, and the capacity of a tile is given as 450, this corresponds to 15 minimum width tracks $(15 \times (20+10))$. 
* If a net has more than 1000 sinks (i.e., $\#pins > 1000)$, you **don't** have to route it. 
* If all pins of a net fall in the same tile, you **don't** have to route it. 


## Output Format (handled by given layer assignment algorithm) 
 ```
 netname id # 
 (x1,y1,layer1)-(x2,y2,layer2)
 [repeat for the appropriate number of segments in nets] 
 ! 
 [repeat for the appropriate number of nets] 
 ```
* Only one of {x,y,z} of two endpoints in segments can be different. 
* The {x,y} must be given as XY locations, the conversion from tile numbers to XY locations can be done with:
 $tile\_x \times tile\_width + lower\_left\_x$ 
 $tile\_y \times tile\_height + lower\_left\_y$.

## Suggested Flow 
![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sk3CYfXsZg.png)

## Benchmarks 
We will run adaptec1, adaptec2, adaptec3, adaptec4, adaptec5, bigblue1, bigblue2, bigblue3, newblue1, newblue2, newblue5, newblue6.


## Router Evaluation
You can use this [perl script](https://www.ispd.cc/contests/08/eval2008.zip) provided from [[1]](https://hackmd.io/fCkL2jC3S469uQ7wk-2gYw?both=&stext=8469%3A10%3A0%3A1775234510%3AYFm3Ix) to check net connectivity and get TOF, MOF, WL of a routing solution.

## Grading 

- Beating the baseline(monotonic routing) get **60%** score.
- The final **40%** will be based on ranking. Note: **Only solutions surpassing the baseline and submitted before last submission date(5/26) will be considered for competition**.

### Ranking
For each benchmark, the results of all students are compared with each other in terms of TOF, MOF, WL, and runtime:
* A less TOF a router has, a higher rank it has. 
* If there is a tie in TOF, MOF is used to break the tie. 
* If MOF is still the same, the routed wire length and runtime are the 2nd tie breaker. 
* The exact quality metric for 2nd tie-breaker is the 
$WL \times (1 + 0.04 \times \log_2(runtime / median\_runtime))$. 

Submissions exceeding the baseline are divided into five tiers:
<center>
    
|Tier| Score Range | Overflow |
|---|---|---|
|4 | 100 | $\leq OF_N$  | 
|3| [99, 90] | $\leq \lfloor \frac{OF_M - OF_N}{1000} \rfloor +OF_N$ | 
|2| [89, 80] | $\leq \lfloor \frac{OF_M - OF_N}{100}\rfloor +OF_N$ |
|1| [79, 70] | $\leq \lfloor \frac{OF_M - OF_N}{10}\rfloor +OF_N$ |
|0| [69, 60] | $\leq OF_M$ |
    
</center>

- Your final score for each case is determined by your assigned Tier ($T$), the maximum available score points for ranking ($ScorePt$), and your relative rank within that tier.
Let $n$ be the total number of students in your tier, and $k$ be your rank within that same tier (e.g., $k=0$ for the best performance, and $k=n-1$ for the worst). 
The formula is:
$$FinalScoreForEachCase = 60 + 10 \times \min\left(4,\left( T + 0.9\times \frac{n - k}{n} \right)\right)$$

    * If the command returned non-zero exit code (unhandled C++ exceptions, segmentation fault, out of memory, ...) → 0 point in this benchmark 
4. `python verifier.py <inputFile> <outputFile> [--submit] [--competition COMPETITION] [-m MESSAGE]`
    * `--submit` is used to submit your score to Kaggle.

    * `--competition` is only needed if you have changed the .gr file name or default file name is correct.

## Q&A
Before asking a question, please check this section to see if it has already been answered. This section will be updated dynamically.
    
- **Q1:** get error
    
    ```
    403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://api.kaggle.com/v1/competitions.CompetitionApiService/StartSubmissionUpload
    ```
    when submit result to Kaggle.
  **A1:** Please join the Kaggle competition first.
- **Q2:** The layers in `3d.txt` are 1-based, but the sample input in the document is 0-based. Which one should we follow?
  **A2:** Please use `3d.txt` as the primary reference for <span style="color:red;">1-based</span> layer representation.
- **Q3:** Is the use of flute, or any other external library, permitted?
  **A3:** Yes, but direct use of external global router is **NOT** allowed.
- **Q4:** What should I do to avoid my code can sucessfully run locally but fails(TLE) in the judge environment?
  **A4:** **Add a timer to your code.** Start it at the beginning and exit just before the time limit. The recommended flow is to find a basic solution first, then use the remaining time to improve it, ensuring you output the best result before time runs out.
